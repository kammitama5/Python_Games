# Python_Games

I haven't made games in a while, and I have gotten a few requests. 
Thinking I may spend the rest of my time until the new year learning PyGame.
Here goes. I'm hoping I can just fit it into one repo.

Most of my Games stuff has been in Java, so this should be interesting...
Maybe I'll get to make some 8-bit art, too, like in the infamous "GnomeRave" :)

I'm not into command-line games; I'd like to do ones with graphics and gameplay, levels, etc.
Ones with pseudo-random generation and tile-art. So we shall see. 
I actually enjoy making those, and I learn a tonne!

Neato tip (12/20): Even though IDLE has no line numbers, you can go to 
Edit -> Go to Line (Alt + G), which allows you to Search number line.


========================================================

Specifically for Snakes! Why did it have to be Snakes!

1. Ensure that pygame is loaded (if you type import pygame into IDLE, you should have no errors).
2. Ensure that both the apple.png and snakehead.png are in the same folder location as the .py file with code for game.
   Note: apple is 30 pixels x 30 pixels, and snakehead is 20 pixels x 20 pixels!
