# Python_Games

I haven't made games in a while, and I have gotten a few requests. 
Thinking I may spend the rest of my time until the new year learning PyGame.
Here goes. I'm hoping I can just fit it into one repo.

Most of my Games stuff has been in Java, so this should be interesting...
Maybe I'll get to make some 8-bit art, too, like in the infamous "GnomeRave" :)

I'm not into command-line games; I'd like to do ones with graphics and gameplay, levels, etc.
Ones with pseudo-random generation and tile-art. So we shall see. 
I actually enjoy making those, and I learn a tonne!
