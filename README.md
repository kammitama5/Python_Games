# Python_Games

I haven't made games in a while, and I have gotten a few requests. 
Thinking I may spend the rest of my time until the new year learning PyGame.
Here goes. I'm hoping I can just fit it into one repo.

Most of my Games stuff has been in Java, so this should be interesting...
Maybe I'll get to make some 8-bit art, too, like in the infamous "GnomeRave" :)
